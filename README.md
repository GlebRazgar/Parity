## Overview 🔎
Duality is an AI agent crew that can take over your browser and complete tasks for you. 

## Steps 🧰:
1. **Task Recording:**
    - Record how you complete a task. The agent will use vision and audio to understand the steps you are taking.
2. **Transcription:**
    - The recording is parsed into actionable steps using GPT4o.
3. **Interaction:**
    - The agent then initiates a browser session, parses through HTML, finds the relevant page elements and interacts with them according to the query.

```

## Run 💥🏃‍♂️🔥
To use the application:
